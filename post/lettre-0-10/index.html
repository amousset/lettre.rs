applications with the following focuses</p><ul><li>Ease of use, without particular knowledge about email</li><li>Secure by default</li><li>Modern (support for full internationalization)</li></ul><p>Non-goals:</p><ul><li>Implementing email RFCs extensively. The goal is to target a modern and safe subset needed to
send emails today, with a nice API (i.e. UTF-8 only, etc.). Particularly, lettre
currently cannot parse emails.</li></ul><h3 id=background>Background</h3><p>The <code>lettre</code> crate was previously named <a href=https://crates.io/crates/smtp><code>smtp</code></a>. It <a href=https://github.com/lettre/lettre/commit/270efd193a11e66dce14700a50d3c42c12e725bc>started</a> in early 2014 (before cargo, Rust 1.0, etc.).</p><p>The first goal was to start a toy project as a pretext to learn Rust. I started with an <code>smtp</code> implementation after seeing there was no existing implementation in Rust. Originally, the project aimed at implementing the <code>SMTP</code> protocol for client and server.</p><p>In 2016, the goal changed, and specialized to email client (as I did not see much use in another SMTP server may it be written in Rust). The project also moved away from &ldquo;just SMTP&rdquo; to email client, and was renamed to lettre at this time. Why <code>lettre</code>? After some time looking for a fitting name, not already taken by email-related software, I ended up just taking the the French word for &ldquo;letter&rdquo;!</p><h2 id=changes-in-010>Changes in 0.10</h2><ul><li>Replacement of the email builder implementation (which was based on <code>rust-email</code>)
by a new one based on the <code>emailmessage</code> crate. To main goal is to provide
sane encoding and multipart with a simple implementation (no message parsing).
<code>email</code> API requires email knowledge and maintaining a facade makes things
harder.</li><li>Merge of the <code>lettre_email</code> crate into <code>lettre</code>, and more features to allow disabling most features.</li><li>Add the option to use <code>rustls</code> for TLS, and use it by default.</li><li>Improved parsing of server responses.</li><li>Moved CI from Travis to Github actions.</li><li>Async support (based on <code>async-std</code>).</li></ul><h3 id=migration-from-09>Migration from 0.9</h3><ul><li><code>Transport</code> API is mostly compatible for most use cases</li><li>Email builder has been replaced but compatibility methods will be added before 0.10 release</li></ul><h2 id=road-to-10>Road to 1.0</h2><p>Lettre is now used by several projects, including crates.io!
It will be good to have a stable basis for the future.</p><p>The plan is that 0.10 is the release preparing the 1.0 in the following months.
I'd also want to add more real-world automated testing with actual mail servers.</p><h2 id=after>After</h2><ul><li>reuse <code>smtp</code> crate for the protocol (a bit like <code>http</code>)</li></ul><p>If you want to contribute, the <code>lettre</code> repo and organizations are definitely open for anything
related to email.</p><p>Depending on the ecosystem evolution, the future may bring an independent SMTP implementation
(similar to the <code>http</code> crate), and a more powerful message representation.</p></article><footer class=site-footer><a href=https://github.com/lettre/lettre>repository</a> ⋅
