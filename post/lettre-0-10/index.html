applications with the following focuses</p><ul><li>Ease of use, without particular knowledge about email</li><li>Secure by default</li><li>Modern (support for full internationalization)</li></ul><p>Non-goals:</p><ul><li>Implementing email RFCs extensively. The goal is to target a modern and safe subset needed to
send emails today, with a nice API (i.e. UTF-8 only, etc.). Particularly, lettre
currently cannot parse emails.</li></ul><h3 id=background>background</h3><p>The <code>lettre</code> crate was previously named <a href=https://crates.io/crates/smtp><code>smtp</code></a>. It <a href=https://github.com/lettre/lettre/commit/270efd193a11e66dce14700a50d3c42c12e725bc>started</a> in early 2014 (before cargo, Rust 1.0, etc.).</p><p>The first goal was to start a toy project as a pretext to learn Rust. I started with an <code>smtp</code> implementation after seeing there was no existing implementation in Rust. Originally, the project aimed at implementing the <code>SMTP</code> protocol for client and server.</p><p>In 2016, the goal changed, and specialized to email client (as I did not see much use in another SMTP server may it be written in Rust). The project also moved away from &ldquo;just SMTP&rdquo; to email client, and was renamed to lettre at this time. Why <code>lettre</code>? After some time looking for a fitting name, not already taken by email-related software, I ended up just taking the the French word for &ldquo;letter&rdquo;!</p><h2 id=changes-in-010>changes in 0.10</h2><ul><li>Replacement of the email builder implementation (which was based on <code>rust-email</code>)
by a new one based on the <code>emailmessage</code> crate. To main goal is to provide
sane encoding and multipart with a simple implementation (no message parsing).
<code>email</code> API requires email knowledge and maintaining a facade makes things
harder.</li><li>Merge of the <code>lettre_email</code> crate into <code>lettre</code>, and more features to allow disabling most features.</li><li>Add the option to use <code>rustls</code> for TLS, and use it by default.</li><li>Improved parsing of server responses.</li><li>Moved CI from Travis to Github actions.</li><li>Async support (based on <code>async-std</code>).</li></ul><h2 id=road-to-10>road to 1.0</h2><p>Lettre is now used by several projects, including crates.io!
It will be good to have a stable basis for the future.</p><p>The plan is that 0.10 is the release preparing the 1.0 in the following months.
I'd also want to add more real-world automated testing with actual mail servers.</p><h2 id=looking-for-contributors-and-maintainers>looking for contributors and maintainers</h2><p><code>lettre</code> is open to contributions, and I would be particularly glad to find
someone interested in maintaining it.</p><p>The <code>lettre</code> organization is also definitely open for hosting anything
related to email in Rust.</p></article><footer class=site-footer><a href=https://github.com/lettre/lettre>repository</a> ⋅
